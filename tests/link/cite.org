* Cite

There are many ways to cite something. Here is a single cite [cite:@OTHER]. It
is also possible to cite two times in a single element [cite:@OTHER;@DUMMY:1].
We can also change the style of a single cite [cite/noauthor:@OTHER].
Or add a suffix to the cite, like a page or paragraph [cite:@DUMMY:1 p. 233].

It is also possible to use all features at the same time or mix them
[cite/text:@OTHER;@DUMMY:1 p. 1337].

** Cite Styles

We map the style of Emacs to Typst:
- [cite/text:@OTHER]
- [cite/author:@OTHER]
- [cite/noauthor:@OTHER]
- [cite/nocite:@OTHER]
- [cite/thistextdoesnotmakeanysense:@OTHER]
